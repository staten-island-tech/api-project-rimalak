            <p class="description">What is it?</p>
            <p class="description">Swimming includes several sports that are practiced on the surface and/or under the water. It allows you to use your whole body to move, sometimes in speed trials, sometimes in artistic routines, but requiring at all times a great coordination. Above all, thanks to the effect of gravity, swimming helps to minimize the impact of force on your body and joints, in addition to being a complete and very accessible sport that can easily allow you to feel like a fish in the water!\n</p>
